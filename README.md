# Chad Cotton Personal Website

Hey there! So it seems you have found your way to the source code for my personal website. This website was created to showcase 
my skills at designing, developing and deploying a website. As for the specifics, the website utilizes the
[Next JS Framework](https://nextjs.org/) coupled with the [Three JS Library](https://threejs.org/) to render three-dimensional objects 
on the page. This website is a working-progress, any feedback would be greatly appreciated, hope you enjoy, thanks!

### [Production Website](https://www.chadpcotton.dev)

## Running the Website

To run the website locally, use npm to run a development environment.

```bash
npm run dev
```
